<body class="ignore-math"><div class="solution solution-like"><div class="para">Let <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> be the number of people. Assume acquaintance relation is symmetric. The possible number of acquaintances any person can have is in <span class="process-math">\(\{0,\dots,n-1\}\text{,}\)</span> which has <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> elements. Observe that not both of <span class="process-math">\(0\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(n-1\)</span> may be used simultaneously within the same set of people. Thus, there are <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> people and <span class="process-math">\(n-1\)</span> choices of acquaintance numbers (either <span class="process-math">\(\{0,\dots,n-2\}\)</span> or <span class="process-math">\(\{1,\dots,n-1\}\)</span>). So by PP, some two people have the same number.</div></div></body>
